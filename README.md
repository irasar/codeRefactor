# CodeRefactoring

## Description 



I have cleaned up existing code to improve readability.
I have added semantic tags to the html file.  Also, I have consolidated the css for greater legibility. There are comments on the css file to better understand the styling. I have fixed all the links in the navigation bar to work. I have not changed the webpage itself.


## Installation

There are no installations for this webpage. It will simply open in a browser window.


## Usage 

You can use the navigation bar to maneuver to certain areas of the webpage.
